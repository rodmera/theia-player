# ♪ NaviTui

**A fast, animated terminal player for [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/).**

Cover art rendered right in your terminal, playback through mpv, five themes
via [ricekit](https://github.com/Gheat1/ricekit) — and everything moves.

## what it does

- **the whole library** — artists → albums → tracks, album views (recently
  added / played / most played / random / all), a flat **all tracks** list,
  **shuffle everything**, playlists, starred, and a global search over
  everything (`/`)
- **real cover art** — kitty graphics protocol or sixel where available,
  truecolor half-cells everywhere else (`NAVITUI_ART=auto|tgp|sixel|halfcell|unicode|off`)
- **a queue that behaves** — add (`a`), play-next (`A`), remove, clear,
  shuffle that keeps the current track, repeat off/all/one; the queue —
  including your position *inside the current song* — survives a restart
- **alive by default** — the wordmark shimmers, the visualizer pulses with
  playback, the progress bar has 1/8-cell resolution and breathes, long
  titles marquee, panels fade in; all driven by one 8fps heartbeat that
  repaints a handful of cells
- **cache-first** — every pane renders instantly from disk, then refreshes
  silently in the background (auto-refresh every 3 minutes)
- **scrobbles & stars** — now-playing + submission scrobbles at 50%, star and
  unstar songs/albums/artists with `f`
- **full mouse support** — click anything, drag the panel dividers, click the
  progress bar to seek, click the volume gauge, click shuffle/repeat
- **five themes**, live-previewed (`t` cycles, `T` picks) — including `clear`
  (your terminal's transparency shows through) and `system` (your terminal's
  own ANSI palette)

## install

You need **libmpv** for playback (everything else ships with the package):

```sh
# arch
sudo pacman -S mpv
# debian/ubuntu
sudo apt install libmpv2
# macos
brew install mpv
# windows: put libmpv-2.dll on PATH — https://mpv.io/installation/
```

then

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Gheat1/NaviTui
navitui
```

First run asks for your server, username and password; the password is never
stored — only the salted token (chmod 600). Works with Navidrome and any
Subsonic-compatible server. Try it against the public demo:
`https://demo.navidrome.org` / `demo` / `demo`.

## keys
